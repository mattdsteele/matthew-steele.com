One of the more interesting films I watched last year was the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0923752/">King of Kong</a>, a documentary about the quest to break (or retain) the Donkey Kong high score world record.  As Zach Leatherman <a href="http://www.zachleat.com/2.0/2007/10/04/the-king-of-kong-2007/">points out</a>, there seemed to be some glaring (if trivial) inaccuracies in the film, such as the exclusion of a third contender for the high score title. Nothing to get too worked up over though; you have to edit the film to make it more enjoyable.  That's show business.

It looks like we've been had.   Jason Scott, a filmmaker working on his own arcade documentary, has some not-so-kind words to say:
<blockquote>[This is] a documentary that rips entire groups of good-hearted people as shadowy, conniving scumbags with razor-thin morality hurts the scene being portrayed and hurts the people themselves. All this effort, just to turn reality into a faked up drama worthy of a dime store pulp.</blockquote>
Some of the core themes of the documentary apparently are conjured up by omitting inconvenient facts that would singlehandedly disprove the theme.  For example:
<blockquote>Billy denies Steve the satisfaction of playing one-on-one on Donkey Kong. <i>They'd played Donkey Kong one-on-one a year before the documentary was filmed at a previous championship.</i></blockquote>
