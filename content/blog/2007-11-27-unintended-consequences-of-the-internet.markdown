So Scott Adams has decided to <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/11/going-forward.html">cut down on his blogging</a>, because he doesn't like losing money being misunderstood:
<blockquote>Every blog post reduced my income, even if 90% of the readers loved it. And a startling number of readers couldn’t tell when I was serious or kidding, so most of the negative reactions were based on misperceptions.</blockquote>
Let me be the first to stake out a controversial position: this is terrible.  Not only is Scott one of the most clear and concise writers I've read, he's popularized <a href="http://basicinstructions.net/">fantastic webcomics</a> and allowed me at least one reprieve from work, every day.

He doesn't need to retire.  I have a solution to his problem:
<h1>؟</h1>
Introducing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony_mark">irony mark</a>.  You use it, get this, to indicate when you're being ironic.  Examples include:
<ul>
	<li>Agile programming is nothing but writing code and complaining؟</li>
	<li>Hillary Clinton should stop running for President and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2233338482">make me a sandwich</a>؟</li>
</ul>
I expect Scott to start posting regularly once again, and my royalty check to arrive shortly thereafter.؟
