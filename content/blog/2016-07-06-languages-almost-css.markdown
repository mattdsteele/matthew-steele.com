title: The Languages Which Almost Became CSS (Recap)
---

[NebraskaJS][nejs] recently held a lightning talk night, entitled "Present a Blog Post". Cool gimmmick, bro.
And you didn't even need to write the post you were presenting on!

Fortunately, I read a fascinating article by Zack Bloom on [The Languages Which Almost Became CSS][eager]: a rip-roaring tour through the process by which we got to the styling language we all know and love (for various definitions of 'love').

I also included a couple lessons I think we can take from the whole experience. And if you listen closely, there's a [Game of Thrones][got] allusion thrown in near the end.

Thanks to Zack for researching and posting such a cool article!
