Over the weekend at <a href="http://barcampomaha.org">Barcamp Omaha</a> I gave a talk on why I practice test driven development. Though TDD is over a decade old, it still isn't a practice we do with much regularity. So this is my Top 5 list of reasons why I think TDD is an important skill to develop.

While prepping this talk, I discovered that only 43% of GitHub repositories from Omaha developers have any tests at all. How many were built with TDD is certainly an even smaller fraction.
