On August 7, we'll be throwing [the first JavaScript conference ever held in Nebraska][site].

[![Logo]({{site.url}}../images/nejsconf-logo.svg)][site]

I'm pretty sure this is the first technical conference held at [a world-class zoo](http://www.omahazoo.com/), and that's just the start. We're planning on a killer lineup of local and nationally-known speakers, as well as showcasing what makes Nebraska such a great state to live and write code.

I'm stoked to be on the organizing committee, alongside folks far more talented than I. If we've assembled the Justice League of Nebraska JavaScripters, I'd be Aquaman.

We're still getting everything ready, but you can [sign up for the conference's mailing list][site] right now.

Hope to see you there!
