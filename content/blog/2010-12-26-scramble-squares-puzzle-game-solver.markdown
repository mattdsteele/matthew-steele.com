My folks got a golf tile puzzle game called "<a href="http://www.b-dazzle.com/puzzdetail.asp?PuzzID=52&amp;CategoryName=Hobbies%20and%20Activities%20Puzzles&amp;CatID=8">Scramble Squares</a>". I was tired of trying to solve it manually, so I wrote a little Ruby app to find all the valid solutions. The code's on GitHub:

<a href="https://github.com/mattdsteele/scramblesquares-solver">https://github.com/mattdsteele/scramblesquares-solver</a>

After uploading it, I realized that quite a few others have already <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=scramblesquares+solver">published solutions</a>. But mine's the only one with unit tests :)
