Lately, 80% of my YouTube usage has been watching Rube Goldberg machines. Here's a few of my favorite:

**The Blue Marble** - This entire channel is so well done.

**The Cake Server** - I love the mechanics as metaphor here. The food theme is infused throughout, and never ceases to delight.

**Wintergatan Marble Machine** - Not a Rube Goldberg machine _per se_, but I think it embodies the essence of the concept. As [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/2018/04/prototyping-wintergatan-marble-machine-x/) notes, "Itâ€™s raw, creaky, clumsy, and beautiful."
