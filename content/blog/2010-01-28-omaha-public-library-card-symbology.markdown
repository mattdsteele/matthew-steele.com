In case you're like me, use <a href="http://www.mycardstar.com/">Cardstar</a>, and want to put your <a href="http://www.omahapubliclibrary.org/">Omaha Public Library</a> card on your phone, here's the custom barcode you should setup:

Symbology: Codabar

Start code: A

Stop code: C

Inverted: no

Hope Google's indexing this. Knowledge is power!
