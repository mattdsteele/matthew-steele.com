title: Hardware is the new Geocities
---

I gave a talk at [NebraskaJS][1] on hardware hacking, Johnny-Five, and the importance of amateur goofery.

It was the most risky talk I've ever given.
I demoed an Arduino-powered Power Glove, modified my slides on the fly with a WebSocket-enabled potentiometer, and flew a quadcopter drone over the audience using a Wiimote.

I also gave a 20-minute version of this at [Barcamp Omaha][barcamp], which you can watch if you enjoy seeing quadcopters crash and burn.
