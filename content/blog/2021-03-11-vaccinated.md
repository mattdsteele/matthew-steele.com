I got vaccinated today, and my primary side effect was feeling conflicted about it.

By my standards, I should still be waiting for months to get immunized. I’m healthy, in my 30s, and have been working remote for virtually the whole last year. But I work for a railroad, which are classified by the state as essential employees in the transportation sector.

I was really torn about this. There are still so many high-risk folks who won’t be getting a chance for at least another month or two. In the state I live, immunocompromised folks are lumped in with the general public, and get no accommodations. And the math is ultimately zero-sum: every dose taken by someone who can manage their risk is a dose that can’t be given to someone more vulnerable.

But ultimately I couldn’t identify a clear distinction between my hesitation, and the more general vaccine hesitancy that’s resulting in large numbers of essential workers. And every recent story of an [outbreak in a nursing home](https://twitter.com/stoddardOWH/status/1369686881542299648?s=20), where 40% of the unvaccinated nurses contracted Covid while 0% of those vaccinated did, solidified the decision.

I really hope we’ll be able to get out shit together and [steepen the curve](https://xkcd.com/2409/), and that we flip from being supply constrained to needing to seek out the remaining folks. But I’m ready to start turning the corner from the last hellish year.
