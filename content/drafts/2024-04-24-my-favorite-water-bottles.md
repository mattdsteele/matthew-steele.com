title: My favorite water bottles
---

Inspired by posts from Cassey and Zach, here's a few of my favorite drinkware.
While I do have a set of mugs I love, I probably get more use out of my water bottles.
They pull double-duty as a daily drinker, and for any activities on a bike.

I've raced Gravel Worlds a half dozen times at this point, and get a new bottle of theirs every year.
It's both functional (at 24oz it's a decent size to throw on a bike) and stylish, and a mainstay of my bottle collection.

Liter-sized bottles are a mainstay of my gravel races. The extra few ounces have kept me from having to carry a hydration pack, and let me make full use of the two bottle cages on my bike.
I especially like these ones from Elite with a protective cap, which helps keep the lid free from gravel dust.
I've eaten enough dirt through the years!

This one's substantially smaller and doesn't actually get on the bike frequently, but it makes me smile every time I break it out.
I makes me want to conquer the Murderhorn, even when I fill it with apple cores and newspaper clippings.
